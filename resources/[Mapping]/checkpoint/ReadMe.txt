Hello,
I put some time into this mapping, so it would be nice if you could rate this mapping on FiveMods.

--------------------------------------



-------------Installation-------------

1. Unzip the "checkpoint.zip"

2. Drag and Drop the unzipped checkpoint folder into your servers resource folder

3. Start the resource/map manually through console F8 -> "start checkpoint", txAdmin-panel or write "start checkpoint" in your server.cfg to autostart it, when starting the server

--------------------------------------



-----------Help-----------

When you need help or want something specific in this mapping like other flags or something else,
you can write me on Discord "Paulus#5802" and I will see what I can do for you :)
